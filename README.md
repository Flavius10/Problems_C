Project: Algorithmic Problems Collection
This file contains a selection of my solutions to various algorithmic problems, solved using C++ and C. The problems cover a wide range of topics, from basic algorithms to more advanced challenges, including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and graph theory.

I used C++ to implement more complex solutions, taking advantage of its object-oriented features and powerful Standard Template Library (STL) for data structures such as vectors, maps, and sets. For simpler or more performance-sensitive problems, I employed C, focusing on low-level programming and direct memory manipulation.

Key aspects of the project include:

    Algorithm implementation: Efficient solutions to problems using common algorithmic techniques.

    Data structures: Utilization of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and more advanced structures like graphs and trees.

    Optimization: Ensuring that the code runs within time and memory limits while solving the problems.

This collection showcases my problem-solving skills in both C++ and C, highlighting my ability to work with both high-level and low-level programming paradigms.
